/**
 * UnreadCountService — Per-User Per-Room Unread Message Counter in Redis
 *
 * PURPOSE:
 *   Maintains a count of unread messages for each user in each room. These counts
 *   power the unread badge numbers shown on room entries in the sidebar.
 *
 *   When a new message arrives in a room and a member is not actively viewing it,
 *   their counter is incremented. When they open the room and send a read receipt,
 *   the counter is reset to zero.
 *
 * REDIS KEY STRUCTURE:
 *   Key:  "unread:{userId}:{roomId}"   (e.g., "unread:42:room_abc123")
 *   Type: Integer string (INCR/DEL operations)
 *   TTL:  None — counters persist until explicitly reset by a read receipt.
 *
 * WHY REDIS INCR IS SAFE FOR CONCURRENT WRITES:
 *   Redis INCR is an atomic operation. If multiple messages arrive simultaneously
 *   (e.g., someone sends a burst of messages), each INCR call is processed one at
 *   a time by Redis's single-threaded command processor. There are no race conditions
 *   or lost increments, unlike an in-memory counter with concurrent writes.
 *
 * LIFECYCLE:
 *   - increment(): called by DeliveryService when a message is delivered to an offline
 *     or non-viewing member. Even online users get incremented if they're in a different
 *     room — the frontend resets the badge when they switch to that room.
 *   - reset(): called when the user sends a /chat.read STOMP frame (they opened the room).
 *     Deletes the Redis key entirely (which reads as 0).
 *   - getCount(): called when a user reconnects to sync their current badge counts.
 *   - getAllForUser(): called to load all room badge counts at once on sidebar render.
