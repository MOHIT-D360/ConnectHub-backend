/**
 * RateLimitFilter — Redis-Backed Per-User, Per-Action Rate Limiter at the Gateway
 *
 * PURPOSE:
 *   Protects the backend from being overwhelmed by too many requests from a single
 *   user. It uses Redis as a fast, shared counter so limits are enforced consistently
 *   even if multiple gateway instances are running.
 *
 *   The filter runs AFTER JwtAuthenticationFilter (order 0 vs -1), so by the time
 *   this filter executes, the X-User-Id header has already been set on the request.
 *
 * HOW THE RATE LIMITING WORKS (sliding-window counter per minute):
 *   1. A Redis key is constructed as: ratelimit:{userId}:{action}:{epochMinute}
 *      The epochMinute is the current Unix time divided by 60 (whole minutes since epoch).
 *      This effectively creates a 1-minute fixed window per action per user.
 *   2. Redis INCR atomically increments the counter for that key.
 *      If this is the first request in the window (count == 1), a 2-minute TTL is set
 *      so the key expires on its own and Redis never accumulates stale data.
 *   3. If the count exceeds the limit for that action, the filter returns HTTP 429
 *      Too Many Requests and adds three response headers to help the client understand
 *      what happened:
 *        X-RateLimit-Action      — which action bucket was exceeded (e.g., "otp")
 *        X-RateLimit-Limit       — what the limit is for that action
 *        X-RateLimit-Retry-After — how many seconds to wait (always 60 for 1-min windows)
 *
 * ACTION BUCKETS:
 *   "otp"    — OTP request endpoints (/api/v1/auth/**otp**) — limit: 5/min
 *              Strict limit prevents SMS/email OTP abuse.
 *   "global" — All other authenticated endpoints — limit: 120/min
 *              General protection against automation or burst traffic.
 *
 * WHY MESSAGE AND MEDIA LIMITS ARE NOT HERE:
 *   Message-service and media-service have their own per-tier rate limiters
 *   (MessageTierRateLimiter) because their limits differ between FREE and PRO users
 *   and because WebSocket messages bypass the gateway HTTP layer entirely.
 *   We skip /api/v1/messages and /api/v1/media in this filter to avoid double-counting.
 *
 * WHY REDIS AND NOT AN IN-MEMORY MAP:
 *   If multiple API gateway replicas run (horizontal scaling), an in-memory map
 *   would give each replica its own counter — user could hit 5× the limit.
 *   Redis is a single shared data store, so all replicas see the same counter.
 *   ReactiveStringRedisTemplate is the non-blocking (reactive/WebFlux) variant
 *   so it works with Spring Cloud Gateway's reactive pipeline without blocking.
