/**
 * RoomService — Core Business Logic for Chat Rooms and Membership
 *
 * PURPOSE:
 *   This service manages everything related to rooms: creating DMs and group chats,
 *   managing membership (add/remove/role), tracking read state, and keeping rooms
 *   sorted by most recent activity. It is the authoritative source for room data,
 *   backed by MySQL via JPA repositories and a Redis member cache.
 *
 * TWO ROOM TYPES:
 *   - DM (Direct Message): a private 1-on-1 conversation between exactly two users.
 *     DMs are auto-named ("DM-{userId}"), always private, and limited to 2 members.
 *     If a DM already exists between two users, createRoom() returns the existing one
 *     instead of creating a duplicate.
 *   - GROUP: a multi-user chat with a name, optional description, configurable member
 *     capacity, and a designated creator who starts with the ADMIN role.
 *
 * SUBSCRIPTION TIER ENFORCEMENT:
 *   FREE users can create at most FREE_PLAN_MAX_GROUP_ROOMS (5) group chats. This
 *   limit is checked against the database count of groups created by the user. PRO
 *   and BUSINESS users have unlimited group rooms. DMs are never capped.
 *
 * MEMBER CACHING:
 *   Room member lists are cached in Redis via RoomCacheService using the key
 *   "room:members:{roomId}". This cache is populated on the first getMembers() call
 *   (cache miss) and invalidated on any mutation: addMember(), removeMember(), updateRole().
 *   Caching the member list avoids repeated DB queries for the high-frequency operation
 *   of "who is in this room?" which happens on every WebSocket message delivery.
 *
 * ROOM ORDERING:
 *   getRoomsByUser() sorts rooms by lastMessageAt (most recently active first), falling
 *   back to createdAt if no messages have been sent yet. This gives users the familiar
 *   chat-app sidebar experience where the most active conversations appear at the top.
 *
 * KAFKA EVENTS:
 *   When a room is created, a "room.created" event is published to Kafka so downstream
 *   services (e.g., notification-service) can react to new rooms being formed. Kafka
 *   failures are caught and logged without blocking room creation.
 *
 * LAST READ TRACKING:
 *   Each RoomMember row has a lastReadAt timestamp. updateLastRead() stamps the current
 *   time when a user views a room, allowing unread count queries to be scoped to messages
 *   sent after that timestamp.

     * createRoom — creates a new DM or GROUP room with the requester as the admin.
     *
     * HOW IT WORKS:
     *   1. Normalize and validate the room type, member IDs, and request fields.
     *   2. For GROUP rooms on the FREE tier, count existing groups and enforce the cap.
     *   3. For DM rooms, check if a DM already exists between the two users — if so,
     *      return it immediately instead of creating a duplicate.
     *   4. Build and persist the Room entity, setting isPrivate=true for DMs automatically.
     *   5. Add the creator as ADMIN and all requested members as MEMBER.
     *   6. Publish a "room.created" Kafka event for downstream services.
     *
     * The maxMembers for DMs is always fixed at 2. For groups, maxMembers is set to
     * whichever is larger: the requested capacity or the actual group size + 1 (creator).
